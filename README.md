### Next Steps ‚è≠Ô∏è
1. DOM Structure
   - Add missing containers
   - Fix element hierarchy

## Technical Notes
1. Constants
   - Now using BOARD object for geometry
   - COLORS object for game colors
   - EVENTS for system events
   - Consistent spacing calculations

2. View Management
   - Player always sees from bottom-left
   - Board rotates 180¬∞ for Player 2
   - Coordinates transform automatically
   - Click handling adjusted for rotation

3. Testing Needs
   - Board initialization
   - Color distribution
   - Player positioning
   - View transformations
