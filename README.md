## Architecture Notes 📝

### Component Structure
- game-container

  - game-area (canvas)
  - color-selection
  - message-area

### Event Flow
1. User Input → UIManager
2. UIManager → EventManager
3. EventManager → Game Logic
4. Game Logic → Network
5. Network → State Update

### Critical Paths
1. Canvas Rendering
   - Calculate size from board dimensions
   - Center in viewport
   - Apply proper scaling
   - Handle window resize

2. UI State Management
   - Single source of truth for status
   - Consolidated message system
   - Proper event propagation

3. Event System
   - Proper initialization order
   - Clear event type definitions
   - Consistent error handling
